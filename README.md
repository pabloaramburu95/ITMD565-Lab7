# ITMD565-Lab7

In this lab we will be experimenting with some additional React concepts like lifecycle events,
components, state and props, JSX, ES6 Modules, and webpack.
The objective is to build a small React application from a few components using JSX. You will
also be retrieving your data from a public API.
